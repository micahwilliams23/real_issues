                    On December 3rd, 2020, Alex Shephard wrote a story for the New Republic titled, <a href='https://newrepublic.com/article/160439/media-trump-election-fraud-video' target='_blank'>"The Media is Finally Tuning Trump Out."</a><br><br>
                    What does the data say?

                    This plot shows the percentage of news story titles from Fox News and CNN from September 2015 until December 2020 that contain the word 'trump'.<br><br>
                    For example, during the week of Sep. 3, 2015, the farthest-left blue dot, CNN mentioned Trump 34 times in 204 titles: 16.7% of the time.<br><br>
                    On many occasions, Trump was mentioned in more than 50% of all the stories in a week.

                    While it is clear that CNN and Fox News talk about Trump very frequently, there is a lot of noise in this data. It is easier to see trends when the y-axis is changed from the raw data to a four-week rolling average...

                    and clearer still when the dots are connected.<br><br>
                    Notice how as an election nears in both 2016 and 2020, both networks mention Trump more frequently. Despite occasional flareups, there does seem to be some Trump fatigue from the beginning of 2017 until early 2020.

                    In terms of raw stories, though, it's hard to see a slowdown.<br><br>
