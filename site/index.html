                    On December 3rd, 2020, Alex Shephard wrote a story for the New Republic titled, <a href='https://newrepublic.com/article/160439/media-trump-election-fraud-video' target='_blank'>"The Media is Finally Tuning Trump Out."</a><sup>1</sup><br><br>
                    I'm not so sure that's true, but if it is, it has been a long time coming.

                    This plot shows the percentage of headlines from Fox News and CNN from September 2015 until December 2020 that contain the word 'trump'.<br><br>
                    For example, during the week of Sep. 3, 2015, the farthest-left blue dot, CNN mentioned Trump 34 times in 204 headlines: 16.7% of the time.<br><br>
                    On many occasions, Trump was mentioned in more than 50% of all the headlines in a week. Clearly, Donald Trump (plus Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric, and the rest of the crew) dominated news coverage over the last five years.
                </p>

                    While it is clear that CNN and Fox News talk about Trump very frequently, there is a lot of noise in this data. Changing the y-axis from raw data to a four-week rolling average makes trends a little easier to see.
                </p>

            <div class='section-contents'>
                <p>
                    Notice how as an election nears in both 2016 and 2020, both networks mention Trump more frequently. And despite occasional flareups, there does seem to be some Trump fatigue slowly coming on from the beginning of 2017 until early 2020 until coverage picks up again for the election.

                    In terms of raw stories, though, it's hard to see a slowdown.<br><br>
                    While the <i>percentage</i> of CNN headlines mentioning Trump might seem somewhat consistent or even slightly decreasing, the total number of headlines mentioning Trump hasn't strayed from the trend.<br><br>
                    As a result, CNN is pumping out just as many Trump stories as ever. From August to December 2020, CNN averaged over 226 Trump stories per week.

                    For Fox News, it's a similar story. The smaller sample size makes it all the more difficult to decipher a trend, but the number of Trump headlines over the last few months is consistent with previous years.

            <div class='section-contents'>
                <p>
                    In total since September 2015, CNN has mentioned Trump in a story title 28,107 times, and Fox News has mentioned Trump 1,689 times.<br><br>
                    It is important to note that the sample sizes for the networks are vastly different in size.<br><br>
                    All of this data was scraped from the networks' respective sites, and the number of stories I found isn't consistent across network or time period. Using Python scripts, I was able to scrape <strong>143,425</strong> story titles from <strong>38</strong> shows on CNN's website. From Fox News, I was able to access <strong>5,957</strong> story titles from <strong>14</strong> shows.

                    The media may finally be tuning Trump out like Alex Shephard said, but either way, one thing is clear: for the last five years, the media has spent far too much time focusing on Trump &mdash;
                    at the expense of other important issues.

                    According to 2019 Nielsen ratings, CNN averaged around 972,000 viewers for its prime time programming.<sup>2</sup> However, in November 2020, with Americans trapped at home due to the coronavirus, CNN's total average primetime viewership jumped to 1.78 million.<sup>3</sup><br><br>
                    When a million plus people tune into CNN, what do they see?
